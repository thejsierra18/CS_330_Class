# 1. How do I approach designing software?
>What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?


In this project, I had the opportunity of working on a project where the base code was already made. Since OpneGL is a well established library, with specific functions, my approach was to understand what I had, and from there applied new concepts, in order to modify and add everything I needed to achieve my end result.

>What design process did you follow for your project work?

The desing process that I followed was to first, understand the codebase I had, then plan the changes and additions I needed to make, followed by the implementation, and finally to modify and refactor my code. 

>How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

I think that this tactics can be applied in future work, as often times, we will work with a pre-made code base, where we will have to implement new features, make changes, and even migrate code. It is important to understand the code first, before we make any changes, which could potentially broke the program if we don't have a thorough understanding on how the codebase works.

# 2. How do I approach developing programs? 
>What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

I did not use any new development strategies when working on the 3D scene. My apporach consisted of iteration, where I would plan, implement, and modify based on how the program was behaving. On each iteration I would add a new object or behavior in the program, and ensuring that everything was working properly.

>How did iteration factor into your development?

Iteration had a major impact in my development, as everything was done and release in small iteration, which allowed my to slowly grow and add functions into my scene.

>How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

The main way that my approach to developing code evolve, was that as we were getting deeper into the course, I would spend less and less time understanding what the code did, and at one point it stopped being a codebase, and it became my code, as I was constantly modifying it and implementing new functions.

# 3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
>How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

Computational graphics and visualizations gave me a new perspective of how to translate elements from the real worlds into our applications. I had not work with OpenGL before, and now I have the foundations needed to work with computational graphics. 

>How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Although I am more interested in working with Enterprise applications and not game development, I have gained valuable skills through this class. I think it is important to at least have a basic knowledge of how all types of software work, as we might have to develop this types of programs when working as a software engineer.
